<div class="psNotesTitle">Notes for Samuel COPPOCK</div>

<div class="psNotesData">One of eight children: Elizabeth, Hannah, James, Samuel, Jane, Rebecakah, John, and Mary.<br /><br />OBITUARY<br /><br />Samuel Coppock departed this life March 20, 1901, at his home near Tippecanoe City, Miami county, Ohio. He was born in Miami county, Ohio, September, 21, 1817. His age was 83 years, 5 months and 29 pays. The Coppock family emigrated to this country from England in its early days. In the family of Moses Coppock, one of an illustrious Quaker family, who, to escape the intolerant requirements of the parish priests and to enjoy the liberty of conscience, came to America to begin life anew. James Coppock, a son of Moses Coppock, was born in New Cay county, South Carolina, February, 1758. In 1759 he, with his mother and sisters, was captured by the Indians. All were killed except James and one sister, 10 or 12 years of age. The sister remained a captive among the Indians, and is believed to have married a man by the name of Coate, who came to Ohio in 1806. It is not known how long James remained a captive, but he finally regained his liberty, and in 1780 he married Hannah Penn. To them were born four children, Phoebe, Moses, Susan and Martha. In 1806 James, with his family, came to Ohio, settling near the present village of Tippecanoe City, where he died in 1837, leaving only one son, Moses Coppock. In 1808, two years after coming to Ohio, Moses married Lydia Jay, and to them were born seven children, Elizabeth, James, Hannah, Samuel, Jane, John and Mary. James Coppock is yet living at Wabash, Indiana in the 87th year of his age. The youngest, Mary, is also living near Laura, Ohio.<br /><br />In 1839 Samuel Coppock was married to Delana Blickenstaff, youngest daughter of Jacob and Mary Blickenstaff, who entered the northeast quarter of section 28, in Monroe township, Miami county, for which they obtained a patent deed from President James Madison, October 12, 1812. In 1856 Samuel Coppock purchased the farm from the heirs of Jacob Blickenstaff, which he improved and continued to occupy up to the time of his decease. To Samuel and Delana Coppock Were born six children, Moses, whose home is Emporia, Kansas; Jacob, of Bethel township, Miami county, Ohio; John, of Monroe; Mary, of Monroe; Elias, of near Campbellsville, Kentucky, and Elizabeth, of New Rockford, North Dakota, all of whom attended the funeral except Elizabeth. He was a member of the Quaker church by birthright, but in 1856 he joined the Brethren or German Baptist church, the church of his choice, in which he was a faithful worker as long as his health permitted. In 1866 he was elected by the church to the ministry. In 1876 he became spiritual counselor and advisor of the church of the district to which he belonged. He held these positions at the time of his death. So well did be discharge the duties incumbent upon him that he was frequently called upon by his neighbors and friends outside of the church to settle their difficulties and disputes. Financially he was successful until about 1860, when his health failed, after which he seemed to lose all interest in financial matters, giving himself almost entirely to church work. He was diligent in looking after the church district, of which he had charge. He was called upon to preach many funerals and perform numerous marriage ceremonies. His education was somewhat limited, but the word of God was always the man of his council. He read his Bible much and it is rather remarkable that, having lived sixty-two years of married life and having raised a family of six children, he, the father, should be the first of the family to cross the Dark River.<br /><br />In his death the wife, Delana, deeply mourns the departure of a faithful husband; the children a kind and indulgent father; the church a faithful servant; the community a friend and neighbor whose place cannot be filled as he filled it. He had a kind word and good counsel for all with whom he associated. His life among us was that of a Christian. His long life, except possibly about two years that he lived near Laura, was all spent in Monroe township. A number of years prior to his death he suffered much from an organic disease of the heart, which, at times, gave him great pain, yet, amid all of his bodily pain and the sorrows which fell to his lot, he never complained. He would often say he was anxiously awaiting the time of his departure, that those afflictions, which are for but a moment, work for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory. His was a noble life, well worthy of example, and while we deeply feel our loss, we know that it is his eternal gain.<br /><br />R. M. E.</div>
