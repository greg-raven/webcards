<div class="psNotesTitle">Notes for Everett Richard WILSON</div>

<div class="psNotesData"><font color="#323232">&#8220;BONSALL -- Everett Richard Wilson passed away Wednesday morning, January 5th, 2011. Born in Glendale California in 1928, Everett was a long-time rancher, raising avocados, citrus, and flowers on a 25-acre  ranch in Bonsall California. He spent his high school years in Vista, California, and was the son of Omar and Janice Wilson. In addition to serving in the Air Force for six years and rising to the rank of Lieutenant, Everett graduated from Long Beach State with degrees in Art and Graphic Design, and he went on to become an Art teacher and Wrestling and Football coach for San Marcos High School. Everett parlayed his art background in many ways. After graduation, he and a friend founded a design company specializing in Danish modern furniture and accessories. He designed and built the home he and his wife and family grew up and lived in, and he dabbled in a variety of artistic endeavors including painting, pottery, welding, macram, silk-screening, and leatherwork. And on many occasions, he could be found with grandchildren, constructing an intricate structure from Legos, Tinker toys and building blocks. He is also the designer and founder of Holly Filters, a filtration system for groves and yards that was utilized by many local farms and groves, and he served on the Board of Directors for Index Mutual and The California Avocado Commission Everett was very athletic and enjoyed many sports, but his primary loves were golfing, surfing, and especially snow skiing. Everett was not only a member of the Big Bear ski patrol, but also a member of the ski team during his time in the air force, and he taught his children and grandchildren to ski. Everett was an avid sailor, winning the Racing Yachtsman of the Year and Skipper of the Year at the Oceanside Yacht Club, and founding the infamous &#8216;Beer Can Racing Series&#8217; that continued long after Everett retired from the yacht club. Fellow yacht club members sported T-shirts that Everett designed and silk screened to commemorate the Around the Coronados races for many years. But perhaps his most ambitious sea-worthy project was designing and building his own sail boat after his existing boat was totaled in an accident during a race. Everett is survived by his beloved wife, Nancy; his children, Jefferson Chambers and Dobie Houson; six grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.&#8221; -- North County Times, Escondido, CA, January 11, 2011.</font></div>
